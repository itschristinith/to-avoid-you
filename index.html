		<title>To Avoid You</title>

		<div class= "page"> 
			<h3>This is for you. Who hollers at me on the street- "hey pretty girl" "i'm single" "etc"
			Do you know how much I don't care? We talke about the emotionality of heckling and the costs of that but what about the practical costs? This is what I do to avoid you... </h3>

			I go <form><input type="number" name="blocks" min="1" max="20"></form> of blocks out of my way 
			</br>
			I pay<form><input type="number" name="taxi" min="1" max="20"></form> to take a taxi instead of walking by where you are
			</br>
			I go <form><input type="number" name="stops" min="1" max="20"></form>more stops on my train commute not to see you when I get off. 
			</br>

			That's how much it costs <h1>#toavoidyou</h1>
